Notes:

`start` - automatically opens an app based on the type of file
* potentially land into unstable

Aliases
* --save
* rest arguments
* being able to pass flags
* precedence of aliases for builtin/external/alias
* May need a way to force an internal command
* Set of common aliases?
  * gedge would prefer starting with empty
* df
* way to print commands aliases separately
* import "alias sets", etc .profile
* once we have alias sets, you could do:
  * `import linux-shortcuts`

More builtin-values
* osname?
* maybe `$nu.sys.system.os`?
* OS => $(sys).system.os could expand to ( $(sys | get system.os) )

boolean
* yes/no sometimes
* true/false sometimes

Completions 
* wrap externals commands with a signature
* needs to preserve order
* flags needs `=` or " "
* global set of flags before subcommands, how do we model that?
* need a set of real world examples that show corner cases
* signature sets 
  * gedge to pair
* modules could possibly match with the command/subcommands hierarchy
* lets subcommands know about the flags on the main command
* Example external completion: `git push j<here> b<here>`
  * git push subcommand
    * required arg 1: ID: 100
    * required arg 2: ID: 101
  * parses as:
    * git
    * push
    * required args
      * remote-name: Shape: String(100)
      * branch-name: Shape: String(101)
* Note: git subcommands have additional subcommand
  * may need arbitrarily deep subcommands

Renames of commands
* we could do deprecation warnings
* upgrade scripts command (migration helper)

Canonical command names
* maybe there's a configurable layer from a name to the canonical Nu name
* eg) `dir` = `list-files`, `ls` = `list-files`

config is tough to change
* `config --edit` could open system text editor
* `config set` etc could be subcommands
* structured edit of config
* we'll lose comments when we save out
* what if `config` was a nu script?

assignment
* `with-env [x 100] { ... }` could possibly be `with-env x = 100 { ... }`
* `config set foo = 100`
* `with-env [x 100 y 200 z 300] { ... }`
* `with-env [x = 100 y = 200 z = 300] { ... }`
* `with-env [x = 100, y = 200, z = 300] { ... }`
* `with-env x = 100, y = 200, z = 300 { ... }`
* `with-env x=100 y=200 z=300 { ... }`
* `with-env [x 100, y 200, z 300] { ... }`
* `with-env [[x 100] [y 200] [z 300]] { ... }`
* ACTION ITEM: 
  * explore adding comma is whitespace  

table comprehensions
* `[with-env [x 100] { ... }]`
* `[ x | x <- with-env [x 100] { ... }]
* `[x for x in with...]`

RFCs
* ACTION ITEM: RFC #1 in the next three weeks

Topics we didn't get to:
`empty?` and related
`if`
Moving to real scripts
* defer to RFC process?
Command types
It's difficult to know if the command works on a table, a row, on columns
Maybe use subcommands to focus on the type
What does a flag mean / subcommands means? What is ideal for subcommand?
eg) `take`, `skip`, etc
subcommands can take flags too
Cleanup of pipeline output
Sometimes you want just one value, not a whole table
`<value>`
what if we didn't show the header
maybe `$it`?
need more viewers (like list of strings)
Cleaning up `autoview`


we may want a strong `where` that can see all columns
We don't have a way to specify a cell location
Picking - subtable ranges
