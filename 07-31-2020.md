* Completions
  * Not a ton of comments on RFC
    * Jason is assuming it's generally good and working on it assuming the RFC is accepted
  * Not a lot of progress yet
    * Jason meet with Jonathan after meeting to look into current prototype.
* Starship
  * Should do an RFC
    * Perhaps more general RFC on "Prompts" instead of "Remove starship"
* Data frames
  * Basically a table with more metadata up front (column names, number of observations, etc)
    * Great for statistical data
    * Homogeneous (data frames) vs heterogeneous (nushell's current format for tables)
  * `math avg` just work across numeric columns, discard others
  * Issues with `ls` not having homogeneous data and hacky solutions to fix
  * `from json` hard to know columsn in advance
    * Would have to load all data to know the "schema"
    * Likely don't want this, so probably need both what we have now along with data frames
  * Probably need an RFC to explore
* Triage team
  * Figure out how we should go about tagging and prioritizing issues
  * How can we communicate major things being worked on?
* Theming
  * Chatted about a generalized renderer
    * Could be cool for WASM, where rendering a "command" would create a link to its help docs
    * Reports? Charts? Perhaps need these to be first-class citizens, or somehow the renderer
      would need to know that "this table can be represented as a chart"
    * `autoview` was kind of intended to act like this, by registering views for data
    * How could we stream tables and have tables/charts/rendered views update in realtime?
  * Colors in general, how do we represent themes?
* Parser changes
  * Eventually engage with community to show what scripts will look like
* Pagination
* Dependency management
  * Removed `nu-build` and `build.rs`
* Line editing
    * rustyline + keybindings
      * A little messy, hard to work with, not entirely satisfying our needs
      * What do we do? Talk about next time / offline.
