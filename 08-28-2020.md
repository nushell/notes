## Nushell - Everything is Data?

* Slogan and motto, how should we use it?
* "Shell for the GitHub era" sounded marketing, but wasn't a good fit
* "Everything is data" is pretty cool
  * "Everything is different" as the subtitle (not like any shell I've ever used)

## Run-up to 0.19, what's needed?

* Get back parity with the previous completion system. Eg) path to executable in the command position
* ..\ stall during completion

## Completions

* Feels like we're a net postive position for completions for 0.19 (modulo fix above)
* Category of a suggestion
  * Actually tag what the results are, like "these are internals" "these are externals" etc
  * Also with docs on the results so we can show more
* For 0.20: given a command and the name of the argument (and maybe partial string) give the results

## Infinity

* Do we want to try to fix `inf`? IEEE standard approach to inf and NaN

## Book

* The book needs a lot of updating for the last few releases
* Should we make it easier to see when we need to update the book?

## Parsing

### Spans

* HIR expansion steps (like it-expansion) doesn't always set Span correctly
```
`foo; bar`
 ^^^^^^^^ span for the first `foo` appear to be incorrect
```
* A/J will chat about this offline

### Completions

* How much do we want to lean on the parser? Vs making the completion engine responsible?
* What about the case where something is missing?
* We may have to experiment and see what feels best. Let's build up the heuristics in the completion engine first, and then make them more general.

### Handling $it and argument invocation too

* We should write more tests. Lots more
* We should aim for natural workflow and not slow down to think of subtlety

Update with a block
```
ls | update foo ${my command}
```

What about invocation?
```
ls | update foo $(my command)
```

Then what about?
```
ls | update foo $( echo {my command} )
```

What would this do?
```
ls | echo $(first | echo $it)
```

### String interpolation

Currently:
* format "{}"
* `{{}}`

* Should we pick a single interpolation style?

* ls | $"this is the format {$it.name} string"

* $name.exe 
  * In other shells, it expands the $name and then appends .exe.
* dotnet style: $"{name}.exe"

* What if we supported: ${name}.exe and then assumed the backticks?
  * $(name).exe - gives you the `exe` column out of the invocation

* Another option: `{name}.exe`. What we have now so you could use { instead of {{
  * `{= $(char lcurly)}` might be too big. Let's clean this up.

* What are the delimiters and what are the rules for how we expand so

* "$(anything)"
* Other shells use: for variable interpolation "${}" or $foo.bar

* Let's look back through the help channel and see how people are trying to do things

* Takeaway: Feels like we *have* to quote something to have string interpolation. Never on bare form.

* Do interpolation rules differ between ", ', and `?

* Should we remove the `format` command?

## Config system

* If we could possibly rewrite:
  * Configuration main set of properties and methods
  * Statically accessible as a singleton
  * Can we model something similar in Rust?

Questions:
  * If we update via `config set` we can also update the file, like we do today. No change?
  * Do we detect if the file has been updated outside of `config`?

* Please let it be possible to use `config set` and not destroy file comments

* We may let it live in the context. Knowing that this would make context even bigger, but maybe worthwhile.

* One possible path:
  * Arc<RwLock<Config>> (focused on readers)
  * Whoever needs config, grab read lock and we'll be fine
  * `config set` grabs a write lock and then updates the in-progress configuration
  * We could optionally inotify to get if the config file was updated
  * Environment merging is something to keep in mind
  * `cargo test` shouldn't read the config.toml. We should be able to have tests to configure how the config file is loaded, and from where
  
## Testing

* Currently we're using `nu!` which invokes the actual Nu to run the test
* We could update the test harness to call into the API now too
* We could move some tests to the faster approach and some to the end-to-end style
* End-to-end tests could move to their own crate
* The "test pyramid" of light and heavy styles of tests, including different types of integration tests
* We need a better way to construct Nu values
