# Meeting notes (31st May, 2020)

Agenda:

- RFCs
- Growing the core team
- Mentoring more folks with an eye to being part of the larger Nu team
- Mental health
- Describing the vision
- terminology
    - Need clear guidelines for what row/table/column means
    - Where can you pass in column-paths?  What types of commands can take them?
    - Using positive settings instead of negative settings
    - Don't have configuration values for what alias can set for us, if alias can override internal commands
        - Try to use an alias
        - But if setting is global or not configurable with flags, use a configuration setting
- Aliases can be taught earlier in the book, possibly
- Remember importance of convention over configuration. Be ergonomic first.
- Importance of being a platform
    - Nu being self-contained is an important feature
    - Nu should "just work" wherever you run it
    - More stability work
    - Move more plugins to being core internal commands
- Guidelines for how a command should work
    - Stability
    - Named
    - What should be a plugin/internal command
    - Features that light up if the library is available vs not being able to compile
        - Or statically link
    - Keep people in flow, don't let people feel blocked

Topics we didn't get to:

- duplicates and having overlapping features
- `empty?` and related
- `if`
- Moving to real scripts
    - defer to RFC process?

- What does a flag mean / subcommands means? What is ideal for subcommand?
    - eg) `take`, `skip`, etc
    - subcommands can take flags too
- Cleanup of pipeline output
- Sometimes you want just one value, not a whole table
- `<value>`
- what if we didn't show the header
- maybe `$it`?
- need more viewers (like list of strings)
- Cleaning up `autoview`
- we may want a strong `where` that can see all columns
- We don't have a way to specify a cell location
- Picking - subtable ranges
